# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Keeping this short and sweat, I'm developping a social media app, centered on a mutual interest in books. The UX is modeled after dating apps like Tindr: from a queried distance, user's will see **only** books within their radius; if two user's "swipe right", a channel of communication is created for them to write to each other.
For the purposes of this class, the app will be developped in two versions: 1) a tricked-out feature-saturated monstrosity that will provide me an opportunity to learn and demonstrate technical skills that I've acquired during Liftoff; and 2) a minimalist app that explores the extremes of the pet concepts and hypotheses behind my design. Perhaps the former version also serves an ulterior purpose; viz. to make clear that the latter version is not perferred over the former, because it is "easier". In fact, I anticipate that the more complex and interesting problems are to be found in realizing a minimalist design.
### Features
-User login with mail verification

-GPS: for pinpointing user geo-locations

-Search: to return results from a queried distance

-Chat: to communicate with other users in real-time

-Reporting abuse & blocking users: forwarded to system admin

-Hashing all tables: even for the silly tricked-out version, this is on the principle that the persistent data for this app is for operation purposes only, period.

#### bonus mission
-A forum for users to create their own dungeons and communicate with other users, agnostic of distance and matches.

-Make it responsive

### Technologies
-Java
-SQL
-Hibernate
-React for the tricked-out 
-Vue for the minimalist
-Javascript
-Bootstrap for the tricked-out
-TBD: I'm currently deciding among GPS services and means of chatting

### What I'll Have to Learn
1) For the front-end, I anticipate that I will have to learn a fair ammount of Javascript, to make the most of React and Vue, in the process of learning them as well. 
2) Even after I decide upon a GPS service and the means of communication, I will have to learn how to impliment them.
3) On the back-end, I'm looking forward to learning more about hashing and other security methods.
And,
4) More about UX externalities
